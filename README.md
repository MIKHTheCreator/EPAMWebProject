Final Java WEB EPAM project

This is pure representation of the bank system with huge amount of options.

This project provides you with:
1. LogIn option
2. LogOut option
3. Registration option
4. Edit User page option
5. Add and create credit card option
6. Make various payments(Some of them are directed to adding balance,  some are directet to substract balance)

8. Delete User credit card and bank account by ADMIN
9. Localization(Russian language and English language are supported)
10. Adding passport info option 

Also all validation(backend + frontend are provided)

While making payment user provides with converter option, so you can add Credit card of 3 currencies(EUR|USD|BYN) while 
payment you will be provided with currency converter, so every payment will be dynamically converted to your credit card currency by todays exchange rate.

Also this project is created in a good design way.

Used technologies:
1. Java EE (Servlets, JSP, JSTL so on)
2. Js
3. CSS
4. SQL (MySQL)
5. Tomcat 

This project contains my own realization of Connection Pool.
All DB queries and CRUD methods are provided(JDBC is used for DB "communication")
Also this project will show you pattern realization(how and where you can use them) such as Command, Singleton, Proxy, DAO, MVC, Factory method, Chain of Responsibility.

I guess that this project is a good way to learn some backend design and connect it to frontend using such Legacy technologies as JavaEE.
